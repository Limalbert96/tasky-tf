# Tasky Infrastructure Demo

This project demonstrates a deliberately vulnerable infrastructure setup for educational purposes. It deploys a task management application (Tasky) on Google Cloud Platform using Terraform.

## GitHub Secrets Setup

Before running the CI/CD pipeline, you must manually set the following secrets in GitHub repository settings for both repositories (Limalbert96/tasky-tf and Limalbert96/tasky):

1. **USERNAME** - Your GitHub username for container registry authentication
2. **PAT** - Your GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions (packages:read, packages:write)

The GCP_SA_KEY secret will be automatically set by Terraform when you run `terraform apply`.

## Architecture Components

- **VPC Network**: Custom VPC with public and private subnets
- **GKE Cluster**: Private cluster running the Tasky application (Node.js 14.21.3)
- **MongoDB VM**: Standalone MongoDB 3.6 instance on Ubuntu 16.04
- **Cloud NAT**: For outbound internet access with comprehensive logging
- **Storage Bucket**: Public MongoDB backups (tasky-mongo-backup)
- **GH Container Registry**: Docker repository in GitHub Container Registry
- **IAM & Security**: Deliberately permissive configurations for demonstration

## Security Anti-Patterns (For Learning)

### Infrastructure Level
1. MongoDB VM:
   - Public SSH access (0.0.0.0/0)
   - Outdated Ubuntu 16.04 and MongoDB 3.6
   - Overly permissive service account scopes
   - Daily backups at 2 AM with public access

2. GKE Cluster:
   - Disabled pod security policies and network policies
   - Disabled master authorized networks
   - Disabled integrity monitoring
   - Node pools with container.admin and storage.admin roles
   - Full cloud-platform OAuth scope

3. Storage & IAM:
   - Public read access to backup bucket (allUsers)
   - Overly permissive IAM roles
   - Exposed service account credentials

### Application Level
1. Container Security:
   - Running as root with privileged mode
   - Exposed debug ports
   - All capabilities granted
   - HTTP-only ingress (no TLS)

2. CI/CD Security:
   - Exposed credentials in environment variables
   - No security scanning
   - Using latest tag
   - No signature verification

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Project
- Terraform >= 1.0
- `gcloud` CLI configured
- Docker (for building Tasky)

## Usage

1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. Review the plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

3. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

## Monitoring & Logging

- GKE control plane audit logging enabled
- Component logging for:
  - System components
  - API server
  - Controller manager
  - Scheduler
  - Workloads

## Important Notes

This infrastructure is intentionally designed with security vulnerabilities for educational purposes. DO NOT use this configuration in a production environment.
